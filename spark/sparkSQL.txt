SparkSQL 
is a spark module for structured data processing. 
Unlike the basic spark RDD API, the interfaces provided by spark SQL provide spark with more information
about the structure of both the data and the computation being performed.
Internally, SparkSQL uses this extra information to perform extra optimizations.
There are several ways to interact with spark sql including sql, the dataFrame API and teh Datasets API.
When computing a result the same execution engine is used, independent of which API/language you are using to express the computation.
This unification means that developers can eaisly switch back and forth between the various APIs based on which provides the most natural way to express a given transformation.

DataFrames
A DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns.
It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database or a data frame in R/Python, but with richer optimization under the hood.
DataFrames can be constructed from a wide array of sources such as structued data files, tables in Hive, external datbases or existing RDDs.

Datasets
a Dataset is a new experimental interface added in Spark 1.6 that tries to provide the benefits of RDDs (Strong typing , ability to use powerful lambda function).
